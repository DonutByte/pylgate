Introduction
============

This project provides a simple way to generate PalGate's derived token, without using third-party libraries!

.. attention::
   This project is based on reverse engineering the PalGate App.
   While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, please be aware of the following:

   1. Some information may be incomplete or incorrect.
   2. The project may not fully represent the original functionality.
   3. Updates or changes to the original app may render parts of this project obsolete or inaccurate.

   If you encounter bugs, inaccuracies, or have improvements please open an `issue <https://github.com/DonutByte/pylgate/issues/new/choose>`_ or submit a PR

Terminology
-----------
Below are some essential terms specific to the project's context.

session token
    Token provided by PalGate's API after successful login


token type
    Type of *session token* can either be ``SMS``, ``PRIMARY`` or ``SECONDARY``


phone number
    Phone number associated with your PalGate account in `international format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.123>`_
    without the ``+`` (plus sign) prefix - i.e just digits

    PalGate refers to it as *user id*


derived token
    Time sensitive token generated by all of the information above
    which is used by PalGate's API as your `API key <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_key>`_

    The whole purpose of this project it to generate this token which is done by calling ``pylgate.generate_token``

    PalGate refers to it as *token* (not to confuse with **session** *token*)

==========
Installing
==========

Install the package using pip:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install git+https://github.com/DonutByte/pylgate.git@main

==========
Usage
==========
0. Install the package check out `Installing`_ for guidance
1. Generate a session token, I have created a `script <examples/generate_linked_device_session_token.py>`_ that acquires a session token using the Device Linking feature, meaning your app will still work
2. Generate a *derived token* by calling ``pylgate.generate_token``, each *derived token* is only valid for a couple of seconds, so be sure to call ``generate_token`` each API call. You can check out an `example script <examples/pylgate_usage.py>`_ that verifies the token
3. Have fun exploring PalGate's API :)
